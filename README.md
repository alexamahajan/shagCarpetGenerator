# shagCarpetGenerator
Shag Carpet Generator tool for Maya, Python script

Used to create various shag carpets with settings controlled by a UI, this tool was developed as an alternative to Maya XGen, due to repeated problems of Maya crashing on my personal computer when XGen was being used.

To use this tool, copy and paste the python script into a new Python tab inside the Maya Script Editor window. The script can be directly used as a tool by saving the script to the shelf. Import "carpetStrandClusterModel.fbx" and convert it to an Arnold Stand-In. Be sure to name the stand in as "carpetStrandClusterModel.ass" in order for the tool to work properly. The stand-in must be located in your Maya project folder.
